# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a mockup for an AI-powered learning app website. The goal is to create a visually stunning and modern user interface using glassmorphism, with a light and transparent theme.

## Implemented Features

### Styling and Design

*   **Glassmorphism:** The core design principle is glassmorphism, creating a "frosted glass" effect.
*   **Light Mode:** The color scheme is based on a light and airy palette.
*   **Futuristic Aesthetic:** The design aims for a "2030s" look and feel, with transparency, gloss, and clean lines.
*   **CSS-only:** All styling is done in a separate CSS file, with no inline styles.

### Current Plan

1.  Create the `index.html` file with the basic structure of the website.
2.  Create the `style.css` file with the glassmorphic styling.
3.  Link the `style.css` file to the `index.html` file.
