            <h2>Our "Story"</h2>
            <p>Manifold.ly wasn't so much founded as it was... discovered. One moment, our founder, Barnaby "Bix" Finglestein, was attempting to toast a bagel in a fourth-dimensional toaster (a long story involving a stolen patent and a lot of temporal butter), and the next, he found himself the proprietor of a trans-dimensional geometry shop.</p>
            <p>The shop, it seems, exists in a state of quantum superposition, accessible from any reality that has discovered both the internet and the concept of a really good, if slightly dangerous, joke. Our mission is to provide the highest quality topological oddities to those brave enough to seek them.</p>

                <h4>Barnaby "Bix" Finglestein - Founder & Chief Paradox Officer</h4>
                <p>Bix is the heart and soul of Manifold.ly. He is currently phased slightly out of sync with our timeline, so he may appear blurry. Do not adjust your screen. He communicates primarily through cryptic crossword puzzles and the occasional booming voice from the heavens.</p>

                <h4>The Intern - A Hive Mind of Unpaid Interns</h4>
                <p>A collective consciousness of all the interns who have ever gotten lost in the stockroom. They handle logistics, customer support, and cleaning up any temporal spills. Their thoughts are a constant, low buzz of existential dread and requests for coffee.</p>

                <h4>A Cat (Probably) - Head of Quality Control</h4>
                <p>We have a cat. We think. It may be a Flerken, it may be a sentient shadow, or it might just be a regular cat named "Susan." It occasionally knocks things off shelves, which we interpret as a rigorous and insightful quality control process.</p>
